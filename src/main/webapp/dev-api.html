			<h3>API</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				In computer programming an API is a collection of subroutine definitions, communication protocols and software building tools. In general it is a collection
				of clearly defined communication methods of the different components. A good API make software development easier, providing all the building blocks
				that the programmer can use.
				An API can be for a web-based system, an operating system, a database system, computer hardware or a software library.
				An API specification can take many forms but often it contains specifications for subroutines, data structures, variables or remote calls. POSIX, the Windows
				API and ASPI are examples of different forms of APIs. The API specification is usually provided to ease the use and application.
			</p>

			<h4>APIs in use</h4>
			<h5>RESTful</h5>
			<p>
				To facilitate the users' searches and their requests we have used a RESTful API through which the user can make requests to our
				database for products and stores and get dynamic results. This is accomplished through the use of endpoints to which
				queries are made that return the desired results.
			</p>
			<h5>Bing Maps</h5>
			<p>
				Additionally, for the user's browsing in an embedded map we have used the Bing Maps API to search for coordinates using addresses
				(geocoding) and the other way around (reverse geocoding). This way the user can see stores on the map and select accordingly.
			</p>

			<h5>Mapbox API (leaflet plugin)</h5>
			<p>
				To draw location data and create and embed maps we have used the Mapbox API along with the leaflet javascript plugin for interactive
				and mobile-friendly maps.
