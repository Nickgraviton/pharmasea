			<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>
				We respect your privacy.If finding success in online business is something you're working on, you're more than aware of how
				much determination you need to have. Of all the details and nuances that need to be addressed to make a company successful,
				increasing customer trust should be high on the list. Because the bottom line is, regardless of whether you have the best products in the world,
				if customers don't trust you, success will not come. A good online privacy policy will make it absolutely clear what information is collected
				and stored and how the information is used. It will state whether there will be distribution of this information by third parties alongside
				the choices consumers have in this regard. Even if your site does not collect information, consumers will not know unless it is posted as part of
				your privacy policy. Doing so will facilitate consumer convenience and increase advertising and online marketing opportunities. There should be a
				statement about the company's commitment to guarantee online privacy and the steps taken to maintain it. In such a competitive market, doing
				everything you can to build trust is a vital part of the success of an online business. Online privacy is not just a concern for consumers.
				If you don't make it a priority in your business plan, you could lose potential sales because visitors don't feel safe giving out the information
				necessary to process a transaction. Don't let failure to have an online privacy policy stop you and your business from success. As popular as
				online shopping has become recently, online privacy is still a burning issue for consumers, and anyone who spends time on the Internet is at
				least aware of the potential pitfalls that can come when personal information gets into the hands of someone with bad intentions. An easily
				accessible and well thought out online policy communicates to your customers that you respect them and are willing to do what is necessary
				to keep their information secure. It lets them know that their privacy is as important to you as it is to them.
